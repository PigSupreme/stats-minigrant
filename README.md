# WebWorK Problems for OpenStax Introductory Statistics

This problem set for Chapters 8-12 of [OpenStax Introductory Statistics](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics) was created through a [Round 14 Affordable Learning Georgia Mini-Grant](https://affordablelearninggeorgia.org/about/r14_grantees). The set uses the open-source homework platform [WeBWorK](https://webwork.maa.org/) by the Mathematical Association of America.

Topics include mean with a known or unknown sigma, proportion, two-sample mean and proportion, goodness of fit, homogeneity, independence, correlation, and regression.
