## Level()
1. problems with this rating should only require direct memory of a fact. Examples might be a specific value of a function, or the statement of a definition. Very few WeBWorK problems fall into this category.
2. usually means students must demonstrate understanding of facts. This is more than regurgitating the fact. We use this category for simple and direct applications of algorithms the student has studied. There should be no judgement involved in choosing the method. This would include a simple application of a rule for differentiation (e.g., can combine rules for sums and constant multiples with one more advanced rule) or for integrals.
3. we use this for carrying out more complicated algorithms, such as derivatives using both the product and chain rule or integrals which involve say both a substitution and parts.
4. these problems require some application of algorithms, but do not rise to the level of a full word problem. For example, "Identify the local extrema for f(x) = ...". One has to apply algorithms and interpret results.
5. word problems
6. Applying definitions theoretically and proof writing
