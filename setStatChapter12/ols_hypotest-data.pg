A study was conducted to determine whether the final grade of a student in an introductory [@ list_random("psychology", "writing", "critical thinking") @] course is linearly related to his or her performance on the verbal ability test administered before college entrance.  The verbal scores and final grades for [$n] students are shown in the table below.
