BEGIN_PGML
A recent study claims that college students, on average, sleep an average of [$mu] hours or less per night. You suspect that the average is more than this, and plan to conduct a hypothesis test. 

[@ $mc0 ->print_q() @]*
[@ $mc0 ->print_a() @]*

In a simple random sample of [$n] college students, the mean amount of sleep (hours per night) is [$xbar]. The standard deviation of the sample is [$sd] (hours per night).

The value of the test statistic for this sample (to at least three decmal places) is [__________].

The P-value for this sample (to at least three decmal places) is [__________].
